Bowlcard
========

Inspired by the [Made Tech bowling kata][bowling] but for me to play with Nimoy

IMHO [Spock][spock] is by far the best unit testing framework for Java and
Groovy

[Nimoy][nimoy] is a port of Spock for testing Python

The goal of this exercise is for me to use Nimoy and see how close to Spock it
is and whether it will be my preferred test framework over Unittest


This excercise will differ from the bowling kata by attempting to replicate a
real bowling score card which will need to keep the history of the game
